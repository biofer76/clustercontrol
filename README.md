# ClusterControl for custom database Docker containers

[ClusterControl](https://severalnines.com/product/clustercontrol) is an all-inclusive open source database management system for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL with advanced monitoring and scaling features.

I created this repository to manage a databases cluster deployed with custom Docker images, in particular when you need to run a database with some extensions or already built-in configurations.

## Requirements:

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose 3.5+

## Manage Secrets

If you want to use Docker containers in production, chances are youâ€™ll want to store your credentials in a secure way.  
A way to do that for Docker Swarm is to use Docker secrets.

### ClusterControl secrets

You must set MySQL root password and CMON Component password
```
echo "password1"| docker secret create CC_CMON_PASSWORD -
echo "password2"| docker secret create CC_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -
```

In this project I'm using [kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4](https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/postgis) Docker image from Docker hub, it includes PostgreSQL 9.6 and PostGIS extension version 2.4.  
It requires default variables for databases initialization, I suggest to use at least PostgreSQL database password as secret, you just have to run:
```
echo "password3"| docker secret create POSTGRES_PASS -
```

You can choose to set more secrets or use environment variables in plain text format in Docker Compose file.

After secrets creation you can list them through listing command:
```
docker secret ls

ID                          NAME                     DRIVER              CREATED             UPDATED
auxdxxtivkm9u9243gir2a70y   CC_CMON_PASSWORD                             5 seconds ago       5 seconds ago
t0xrvb0hmlcpoo3xd6fd2p20u   CC_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD                       4 seconds ago       4 seconds ago
wfptqxlun4jeusutcgs2h3hoa   POSTGRES_PASS                                3 seconds ago       3 seconds ago
```

For the full list of available variables and default values please check original project: [kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4](https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/postgis)

## How it works

First of all you have to build the PostGIS database Docker image, it starts from `kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4` image and then adds all required packages to work with ClusterControl.  
I created a new `entrypoint.sh` as bash scripts wrapper in order to include entrypoint files from `kartoza/postgis:9.6-2.4` and `clustercontrols` Docker projects.

Build the  master PostGIS Docker image:
```
docker-compose build pg_master 
```

When new image postgis:9.6-2.4 is be ready, you can launch your ClusterControl databases manager and a cluster of PostGIS databases, cluster includes:

- 1 PostGIS Master node
- 2 PostGIS Slave nodes
